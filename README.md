# Terraform vSphere
Some simple modules and examples I have created while playing with Terraform and vSphere.
**Note:** the backend is local, but I may play with S3, Blob, Datastore, etc

## Modules
Includes a simple Windows and Linux VM cloned from a template.

## Roots
Includes example instantiations.
